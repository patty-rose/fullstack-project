This repo definitely does not look like what you were expecting. My apologies!
I mistakenly uploaded the fullstack-project to GitHub without creating a main/master branch as instructed. However, I have created a branch with all the necessary changes and opened a pull request for review. Apologies for any confusion caused.

Thank you for your consideration!
